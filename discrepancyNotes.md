Discrepancy between two definitions of "user." Two Definitions:
* A personal trainer, an admin, or a trainee that attends the gym and uses myJym.
* Clients that will use the app to progress with their training and receive help and support from trainers
Decision is based on how the word is used throughout our documents. One way it is used is: "Allow users and trainers to archive (save and store) their data (goals, workouts, clients, etc..)" which makes users appear to be gym attendees.
Solution: Use second definition, and include a definition of "client," being "a gym-goer that uses the myJym app"
